# 📘 Lecture 2: How Do LLMs Learn Language?

---

## 🎯 Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) learn to generate and understand human language by **analyzing massive amounts of text data** and learning statistical patterns. They don't learn grammar like students—they learn what words and phrases are likely to appear together based on context.

---

## 🧠 Key Ideas

- **LLMs learn by predicting the next token** in a sentence (e.g., “The cat sat on the ___” → “mat”).
- They are trained on **gigabytes to terabytes of text** from books, websites, forums, and more.
- Learning happens via a method called **unsupervised learning**—no labeled answers are needed.
- Training uses **backpropagation** and **gradient descent** to reduce prediction errors over time.

---

## 🔁 The Next-Token Prediction Task

LLMs are trained to do one thing very well:
> Given a sequence of words (tokens), **predict the most likely next token**.

This simple task powers their ability to write, summarize, translate, and more.

---

## 🧪 Simple Example

**Training input:**  
“Once upon a time, there was a brave little”

**Target output:**  
“girl”

The model learns that in stories, the word “girl” is a likely continuation of that phrase.

---

## 🔧 What Happens During Training?

1. Input text is **tokenized** into chunks  
2. Model tries to predict the next token  
3. If wrong, it adjusts its internal parameters (weights)  
4. Repeats billions of times across data  
5. Gradually improves predictions and general language skill

---

| Websites             | News articles, blogs, forums                |
| Code                 | Open-source repositories (for coding LLMs)  |
| Conversations        | Chat logs, transcripts                      |

---

## 🧠 Clarification

LLMs don’t “understand” language like humans.  
They **recognize patterns** in language and use statistical inference to generate likely responses.

---

## 🌍 Analogy

> **LLM = Parrot + Calculator**

Like a parrot, it mimics patterns it has seen.  
Like a calculator, it computes probabilities.  
But unlike either, it does this at an incredible scale and with human-like fluency.

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- LLMs learn by predicting the next token using large text datasets  
- Training is unsupervised and requires massive compute resources  
- They're not taught language rules—they discover patterns statistically  
- Their power comes from scale, architecture, and learning from diverse data

# 📘 Lecture 3: The Transformer Architecture

---

## 🎯 Overview

The **Transformer** is the deep learning architecture behind modern Large Language Models (LLMs). Introduced in 2017, it replaced older models like RNNs and LSTMs by enabling better handling of long-range language patterns—and doing so much faster.

---

## 🧠 Key Ideas

- **Transformers process all tokens at once**, not one at a time.
- They use a mechanism called **self-attention** to determine how important each word is to the others.
- Transformers are the foundation of models like GPT, BERT, and T5.

---

## 🔑 Core Components

| Component         | Purpose                                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Self-Attention    | Lets the model focus on relevant parts of the input sequence        |
| Positional Encoding | Adds order info (since transformers process all tokens in parallel)|
| Multi-Head Attention | Looks at the input from multiple perspectives simultaneously     |
| Feedforward Layers | Apply learned transformations to token representations             |
| Layer Norm & Residuals | Help with stability and faster training                         |

---

## 🔁 Self-Attention Explained

Instead of looking at one word at a time, self-attention allows every word in a sentence to **pay attention to every other word**, and assign weights to how important each one is.

---

### 🧪 Example

**Input:**  
“The cat sat on the mat.”

- When processing “sat”, the model can also consider “cat” and “mat” strongly.
- It calculates how related each word is to “sat” and weighs them accordingly.

---

### 📊 Visualization (Conceptual)

| Word     | Attention to “cat” | Attention to “sat” | Attention to “mat” |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **sat**  | 0.7                | 1.0                | 0.6                 |

---

## 🌐 Positional Encoding

Since transformers don't process words in order like RNNs, they use **positional encodings** to add a sense of order and location in the sentence.

Think of it like adding a timestamp to each word so the model knows where it appears in the sentence.

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters

- Enables **parallel processing** → faster training  
- Captures **context better** than older models  
- Handles **long texts** more effectively  
- Foundation for nearly all modern LLMs (GPT, BERT, T5, LLaMA)

---

## 🌍 Real-Life Analogy

> **Transformer = Team of Editors Reading the Same Document at Once**

Each “editor” looks at the whole sentence and focuses on the parts most relevant to their task. Then, they share what they found, combine it, and improve the document together.

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Transformers are the backbone of LLMs, replacing older sequential models  
- Self-attention allows each word to consider every other word  
- Positional encodings give tokens a sense of order  
- This architecture enables powerful, parallel, and scalable language understanding

---

# 📘 Lecture 4: Tokens and Tokenization

---

## 🎯 Overview

Before a Large Language Model (LLM) can understand or generate text, it must **convert text into tokens**—the basic building blocks the model understands. This process is called **tokenization**.

---

## 🧠 Key Ideas

- A **token** is a chunk of text—usually a word, subword, or character.
- Tokenization breaks raw text into these tokens for processing.
- LLMs operate on tokens, not on whole sentences or words directly.
- Different models use different tokenization schemes (e.g., BPE, WordPiece).

---

## 🧩 Types of Tokens

| Type        | Example for the word “unbelievable”         |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Word-based  | `["unbelievable"]`                          |
| Subword     | `["un", "believ", "able"]`                  |
| Character   | `["u", "n", "b", "e", "l", "i", "e", ...]`   |

Most modern LLMs use **subword tokenization**, which balances vocabulary size and flexibility.

---

## 🧪 Example

**Sentence:**  
> “The dog chased the cat.”

**Tokenized (subword):**  
> `["The", "Ġdog", "Ġchased", "Ġthe", "Ġcat", "."]`  
(*Note: 'Ġ' represents a space in some tokenizers*)

---

## 🔁 Why Tokenization Matters

- **Efficiency**: Reduces vocabulary size while keeping expressive power  
- **Flexibility**: Can handle rare words or typos by breaking them into parts  
- **Foundation**: All LLM learning and output is based on tokens

---

## 🔧 Token Count and Cost

LLMs process a limited number of tokens per input. This affects:

- **Context window** (how much history the model can remember)
- **Pricing** in API-based models (e.g., OpenAI charges per 1,000 tokens)

---

## 📊 Real-World Comparison

| Text                         | Approximate Tokens |
|------------------------------|--------------------|
| One Tweet (280 characters)   | ~50–70 tokens      |
| One page of text             | ~500–700 tokens    |
| A novel (80,000 words)       | ~100,000+ tokens   |

---

## 🌍 Real-Life Analogy

> **Tokens = LEGO Bricks of Language**

Just like LEGO pieces snap together to build something big, tokens combine to build sentences and ideas. Some are big (like full words), others are small (prefixes/suffixes), but they all fit into the LLM’s construction process.

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Tokens are the smallest units LLMs understand and process  
- Tokenization converts text into these units before any modeling occurs  
- Subword tokenization is widely used for efficiency and robustness  
- Token limits affect what an LLM can see or generate at once  
- Understanding tokens helps you write better prompts and manage costs

---

# 📘 Lecture 5: Prompting LLMs

---

## 🎯 Overview

A **prompt** is the input you give to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a response. How you write the prompt dramatically affects the quality, accuracy, and usefulness of the output.

Prompting is both an art and a science—understanding how to phrase instructions is crucial to getting the results you want.

---

## 🧠 Key Ideas

|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Zero-shot prompting    | Ask directly, with no examples                            | “Translate to French: I love books.”                      |
| Few-shot prompting     | Give examples before your query                           | “Translate: Dog → Chien; Cat → Chat; Book → ?”            |
| Role prompting         | Assign a role or persona to the model                     | “You are a helpful tutor. Explain gravity to a child.”    |
| Chain-of-thought       | Encourage step-by-step reasoning                          | “Explain your reasoning before answering.”                |

---

## 🧪 Example Prompts

1. **Informational:**  
   > “Explain black holes in simple terms.”

2. **Creative:**  
   > “Write a short poem about the ocean in the style of Shakespeare.”

3. **Role-based:**  
   > “You are a software engineer. Review this code for errors.”

4. **Step-by-step:**  
   > “Solve this math problem step-by-step: 87 × 34”

---

# 📘 Lecture 1: Introduction to Agentic AI & Prompt Engineering

## 🎯 Overview

Agentic AI represents a shift from passive AI models to active, autonomous systems. These systems **plan**, **reason**, **invoke tools**, and **adapt** to fulfill user goals. Prompt engineering is the key to enabling this behavior.

---

## 🤖 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can:

- **Understand a goal or objective**
- **Plan** a sequence of steps to achieve it
- **Act** (e.g., call tools, retrieve data, generate responses)
- **Reflect and adjust** based on outcomes

### 🧠 Example:
> “Book a meeting with John, get the weather for Monday, and summarize the plan in an email.”

An agent must:
1. Understand the user’s intent.
2. Query calendars and weather APIs.
3. Compose a contextual email.

---

## 🧰 Role of Prompt Engineering in Agentic AI

Prompt engineering enables:

| Task                             | Prompt’s Role                                           |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Define user intent               | Guide the agent’s goal interpretation                   |
| Tool invocation                  | Provide syntax and format to call functions or APIs     |

# 📘 Lecture 2: Designing Prompts for Autonomous Decision-Making

## 🎯 Overview

In agentic AI, the model must **make decisions** on its own—whether that’s choosing a tool, selecting a response path, or planning multiple steps. Prompt engineering guides this process by framing the environment, constraints, and reasoning patterns the agent should follow.

---

## 🤖 What is Autonomous Decision-Making?

Agentic AI systems are expected to:

- **Interpret** the user’s objective  
- **Choose** the best next action  
- **Execute** the action (e.g., call a tool, return a response)  
- **Reflect or revise** based on the results

To support these actions, prompt engineering must guide:

- Goal interpretation  
- Action planning  
- Prioritization and conditional logic  
- Fallback or retry behavior

---

## 🔑 Prompt Design Principles for Decision-Making

### 1. Explicit Role and Task

"You are an assistant that can search the web and summarize news."

### 2. Structured Decision Chains

"First, determine if the question needs external data. If yes, call the web search tool. If not, answer directly."

### 3. Conditional Instructions

"If the user mentions weather, call the weather API. Else, ask a clarifying question."

### 4. Reasoning Aids

"Before answering, think aloud and explain the steps you are taking."

---

## 🔁 Prompt Pattern: Decide-Then-Act

**Pattern:**  
You are an assistant agent. Given the user query:

1. Decide what the user's intent is.  
2. Decide if a tool is needed (Yes/No).  
3. If yes, specify the tool and its input.  
4. Return a structured response with your reasoning.

This pattern simulates **agentic thinking** and helps models reason before acting.

---

## 🧠 Prompt Example for Decision Flow

**Prompt:**  
You are an AI travel planner. When the user asks for a destination:  
- Decide if they mentioned weather or budget.  
- If yes, call the appropriate API.  
- If not, return 3 general suggestions with explanations.

This prompt ensures structured reasoning and conditional tool use—hallmarks of decision-making agents.

---

4. **Output Handling:** How to report or act on results

---

## 🧠 Prompt Example: Weather API

**Prompt:**  
"You have access to a weather API that takes a city name and returns the current temperature.  
If the user asks about weather, call the API using this format:  
`weather(city='CityName')`.  
Return a response like:  
'The temperature in CityName is X degrees.'"

---

## ⚙️ Prompt Template for Generic Tool Use

**Prompt Template:**  
You are an agent. You have access to the following tools:  

- `tool_name_1`: [description]  
- `tool_name_2`: [description]

When answering user questions:  

- Identify if a tool is needed  
- Use correct syntax to call the tool

Agentic AI often needs to complete tasks that span multiple reasoning steps or actions. This lecture explores how to design prompts for **multi-step planning and execution**, known as **prompt chaining**.

---

## 🔗 What is Prompt Chaining?

Prompt chaining involves breaking down a task into **smaller sub-tasks**, where:

- Each sub-task is handled by a separate prompt
- The output of one becomes the input of the next
- The agent follows a logical flow of execution

---

## 🧠 Why Use Chaining?

| Challenge                     | Solution Through Chaining              |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Complex tasks                | Break into simpler subtasks            |
| Tool interaction + reasoning | Separate reasoning and tool usage      |
| Sequential logic             | Maintain state and flow through steps  |

---

## 🔁 Example: Job Application Agent

**Task:** Help a user apply for a job

1. **Prompt 1:** “Summarize the job description.”
2. **Prompt 2:** “Extract required qualifications from the summary.”
3. **Prompt 3:** “Check if the user meets those qualifications.”
4. **Prompt 4:** “Draft a personalized cover letter.”

Each step builds on the previous, allowing modular and verifiable reasoning.

---

## 🧰 Modular Prompting Format

Each module should include:

- **Clear goal**

# 📘 Lecture 5: Error Handling and Refactor Prompts in Agents

## 🎯 Overview

In real-world use, agentic AI may produce incorrect, incomplete, or irrelevant outputs. This lecture covers how to build **error handling** and **self-correction** into prompts, making agents more robust and self-aware.

---

## ❗ Why Error Handling is Essential

Agents must gracefully handle:

- Incorrect tool calls
- Missing context or inputs
- Unexpected outputs
- User misunderstandings

Prompt engineering can help models **detect**, **report**, and **recover** from such issues.

---

## 🔁 Common Agent Errors and Fixes

| Error Type               | Example Scenario                           | Prompt Solution                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Missing input            | User asks to schedule but no time provided| Ask clarifying question                     |
| Tool failure             | API call returns error or null             | Retry or suggest alternative                |
| Incomplete reasoning     | Agent skips a step                         | Include checklist or plan structure         |
| Contradictory behavior   | Agent gives conflicting answers            | Add consistency checks in prompt            |

---

## 🧠 Prompt Pattern: Verify-Then-Act

Prompt structure example:

1. Interpret the task  
2. Validate if all inputs are available  
3. If not, ask the user for missing info  
4. Proceed only when all conditions are met

**Example Prompt:**  
“You are a meeting assistant. If time, date, or attendees are missing, ask for them before booking.”

---

## 🔄 Refactoring Prompts for Reliability

If a prompt is producing inconsistent results:

- Break it into smaller sub-prompts  
- Use clearer role and context statements  
- Add example inputs and outputs  
- Include explicit validation logic

**Before:**  
“Book a meeting for tomorrow.”

**After:**  
“You are a scheduling agent. First check if the user has provided time, date, and participants. If any are missing, request them. Then confirm the booking.”

---

## 🧰 Techniques for Error-Resilient Prompts

- Add “checklist” instructions  
- Use conditionals like “if X not provided, then ask”  
- Allow the agent to output a warning message  
- Log and explain internal errors to user

---

## 🌍 Real-Life Analogy

Think of an AI agent like a junior assistant. If you say “book a call,” they should ask:

- “When?”  
- “With whom?”  
- “Where?”  

Instead of making assumptions, they ask to clarify—just like a well-designed agent prompt should.

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Prompts should anticipate missing or bad inputs  
- Add fallback logic to ask, retry, or clarify  
- Refactor prompts that don’t perform reliably  
- Error-resilient agents are more trustworthy and usable

# 📘 Lecture 7: Controlling Output Style, Format, and Tone

## 🎯 Overview

Agentic AI must generate outputs that are not only correct, but also **well-formatted, styled appropriately, and aligned with the intended tone**. This lecture explores prompt techniques that shape how agents communicate, not just what they say.

---

## 🧠 Why Output Control Matters

- Professional settings require formal tone
- APIs may require structured JSON
- Emails may need polite, persuasive wording
- Reports need bullet points, summaries, or formatting

Prompting helps enforce this consistently.

---

## 🧰 Output Control Parameters

| Output Feature   | Controlled By Prompt? | Example                                 |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Format           | ✅ Yes                 | "Return result as a bullet list"         |
| Style            | ✅ Yes                 | "Write in an academic tone"              |
| Length           | ✅ Yes                 | "Keep answer under 100 words"            |
| Structure        | ✅ Yes                 | "Respond in JSON format with keys: ..."  |

---

## 🎨 Prompt Templates for Style and Format

**Formal Prompt Example:**  
"You are an executive assistant. Draft a formal email apologizing for the meeting reschedule."

**JSON Output Prompt:**  
"Respond with JSON in the format: { 'destination': '', 'temperature': '', 'activities': [] }"

**Bullet Point Prompt:**  
"List the pros and cons of remote work in bullet point format."

**Friendly Tone Prompt:**  
"Use a casual and cheerful tone. Say 'Hi!' and thank the user warmly."

| Method           | When to Use                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Prompt Engineering | When tone/format must come directly from the model |
| Post-Processing  | When structure or validation is needed afterward |

Prompting is best when style needs to be **visible to users immediately**.

---

## 🔍 Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Forgetting to specify format or tone leads to generic responses
- Overloading the prompt with too many conflicting style instructions
- Using vague terms like “make it good” instead of “make it persuasive”

---

## 🌍 Real-Life Analogy

### 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
Encourages step-by-step reasoning.

**Prompt:**  
“Think step by step before giving your final answer.”

### 2. Tree-of-Thought (ToT)
Explores multiple reasoning paths before selecting the best one.

**Prompt Structure:**  
“List three different approaches to solving this, then select the most effective.”

### 3. Self-Consistency
Generates multiple answers, then picks the most frequent or best one.

**Use Case:**  
Mathematical problem solving or ambiguous queries.

### 4. Reflexion
Agent reflects on whether its response was good, then retries.

**Prompt Template:**  
“Was your last answer correct? If not, revise it and try again.”

### 5. Tool-Augmented Planning
Plan tool calls in a sequence, not just reactively.

**Prompt Template:**  
“Plan your next 3 steps. If one includes using a tool, describe when and why.”

# Lecture 13: Autonomous Research Agents

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

- Understand the architecture of research-oriented agents.
- Combine retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reasoning and memory.
- Build an agent that can read, analyze, and summarize documents.
- Apply autonomous loops to extract insights from multi-source information.

## ðŸ§© Key Concepts

### What Is a Research Agent?

- An LLM-powered agent capable of:
  - Searching and retrieving relevant documents
  - Extracting insights or answering questions
  - Summarizing long or complex content
  - Operating across multiple iterations if needed

### Key Techniques

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**:
  - Retrieve relevant data from a corpus
  - Feed it into the prompt context before generation
- **Multi-hop Reasoning**:
  - Chain insights across documents or queries
- **Memory + Tools**:
  - Combine long-term memory, embeddings, and tools like search or summarizers

---

## ðŸ›  Required Tools/Libraries

- LangChain
- FAISS or ChromaDB
- OpenAI / Hugging Face models
- PyPDF or Docx reader (for ingesting documents)

    pip install langchain faiss-cpu openai pypdf

## ðŸ”¬ Hands-on Exercise: Build a Research Assistant Agent

**Goal**: Build an agent that answers questions about uploaded documents.

### Step 1: Load and Chunk PDF

    from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
    loader = PyPDFLoader("sample_paper.pdf")
    docs = loader.load_and_split()

### Step 2: Embed and Store in FAISS

    from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
    from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings)

### Step 3: Create a Retrieval QA Chain

    from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI

    retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
    chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), retriever=retriever)

    response = chain.run("What are the key contributions of the paper?")
    print(response)

### Bonus:

- Enable multi-turn conversations with memory across follow-up questions.
- Add summarization as a post-processing step.
- Try ingesting multiple sources (PDFs, websites, Wikipedia) into a single agent.

# Lecture 21: Real-World Use Case â€“ AI Research Assistant

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

- Design an LLM-powered assistant for technical or academic research tasks.
- Retrieve, read, and extract insights from scientific papers or long documents.
- Enable semantic search, tagging, summarization, and question answering.
- Combine multiple tools and memory for deep document understanding.

## ðŸ§© Key Concepts

### What Is an AI Research Assistant?

An agent that helps users:
- Read and summarize academic papers
- Extract key ideas, methods, and results
- Answer technical questions
- Link related work or suggest further reading

### Agent Workflow

1. **Ingest**: Load PDFs or URLs
2. **Chunk**: Split into manageable text segments
3. **Embed**: Create vector representations for semantic search
4. **Retrieve**: Find relevant sections by query
5. **Reason**: Answer or summarize using the LLM
6. **Memory**: Store session context for follow-up Q&A

---

## ðŸ›  Required Tools/Libraries

- Python
- LangChain
- FAISS or ChromaDB
- PyPDFLoader
- OpenAI API (or Hugging Face)

    pip install langchain faiss-cpu openai pypdf

## ðŸ”¬ Hands-on Exercise: Build a Research Assistant Agent

**Goal**: Create an agent that can summarize and answer questions about uploaded research papers.

### Step 1: Load and process PDF

    from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
    loader = PyPDFLoader("transformers_survey.pdf")
    documents = loader.load_and_split()

### Step 2: Create vector index

    from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
    from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    db = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)

### Step 3: Build retrieval + QA chain

    from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI

    retriever = db.as_retriever()
    chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), retriever=retriever)

    question = "What are the main challenges of training transformer models?"
    answer = chain.run(question)
    print(answer)

### Bonus:

- Add memory to handle follow-up questions.
- Allow multi-file querying across several papers.
- Integrate Arxiv API to auto-download papers by topic or keyword.

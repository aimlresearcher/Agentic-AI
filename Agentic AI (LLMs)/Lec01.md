# Lecture 01: Introduction to Agentic AI

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

- Define what agentic AI is and how it differs from traditional AI systems.
- Understand the core components of an agent (e.g., perception, reasoning, action).
- Recognize real-world examples of agentic behavior.
- Grasp the motivation for integrating agency into large language models (LLMs).

## üß© Key Concepts

- **Agent**: An entity that perceives its environment and acts upon it to achieve goals.
- **Agentic AI**: AI systems that exhibit autonomy, decision-making, and goal pursuit over time.
- **Traditional AI vs. Agentic AI**:
  - *Traditional AI*: Often task-specific (e.g., classification, translation).
  - *Agentic AI*: Embeds reasoning, planning, memory, tool use, and goal adaptation.

### Components of Agentic AI
- **Perception**: Ingests input from the environment (e.g., user input, documents).
- **Memory**: Stores relevant past information for long-term use.
- **Planning**: Breaks goals into subtasks and organizes actions.
- **Action**: Executes commands, queries APIs, or invokes tools to accomplish tasks.

### Why LLMs are Well-Suited for Agentic AI
- Natural language understanding and reasoning
- Broad general-purpose capabilities
- Flexible prompting and tool integration

## üõ† Required Tools/Libraries

- None required (conceptual introduction)
- *Optional*: Diagramming tools (e.g., [draw.io](https://draw.io), Excalidraw)

## üî¨ Hands-on Exercise: ‚ÄúAgent or Not?‚Äù

Create a table of at least 8 real-world systems (human, software, or robotic) and classify each as:
- ‚úÖ Agentic  
- ‚ùå Non-agentic  

Justify your classification based on whether the system can perceive, plan, and act autonomously.

| System                  | Agentic? | Why / Why Not?                                     |
|------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Siri                   | ‚úÖ        | Perceives voice, makes decisions, takes actions   |
| Excel spreadsheet      | ‚ùå        | Passive tool, requires user to act                |
| Roomba                 | ‚úÖ        | Perceives environment, navigates, avoids objects  |
| Traditional ML model   | ‚ùå        | Static prediction, no ongoing action or planning  |
| GPS Navigation System  | ‚úÖ        | Updates route based on traffic, gives directions  |
| Static Webpage         | ‚ùå        | Displays content but takes no autonomous action   |
| Customer Support Bot   | ‚úÖ        | Responds to queries, may escalate, routes tasks   |
| Video Game AI Opponent | ‚úÖ        | Makes decisions based on user actions in-game     |

**Bonus**: Sketch or diagram the **Perception ‚Üí Memory ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Action** loop of an agentic system.

# Lecture 20: Real-World Use Case â€“ DevOps Agent

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

- Understand how LLM agents can support DevOps workflows.
- Build an agent that monitors, queries, and responds to system states.
- Integrate tools like shell commands, logging, and alerting systems.
- Deploy a task-specific automation agent for system health and maintenance.

---

## ðŸ§© Key Concepts

### What Is a DevOps Agent?

An agent that:
- Observes system metrics or logs
- Executes diagnostic or repair commands
- Sends alerts or reports
- Operates on a schedule or in response to triggers

### Typical DevOps Tasks

- Uptime and availability checks
- Log parsing and anomaly detection
- Disk/memory usage monitoring
- Automated remediation (e.g., restart service)

---

## ðŸ›  Required Tools/Libraries

- Python
- psutil (for system info)
- subprocess (for shell execution)
- LangChain (optional for prompt/agent structure)
- cron or schedule (for time-based tasks)

    pip install psutil schedule langchain openai

## ðŸ”¬ Hands-on Exercise: Create a System Monitor Agent

**Goal**: Build an agent that checks CPU usage, restarts services if needed, and sends a summary.

### Step 1: Define system info tools

    import psutil

    def get_cpu_load():
        return psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)

    def get_memory_usage():
        return psutil.virtual_memory().percent

### Step 2: Define command execution tool

    import subprocess

    def restart_service(service_name):
        return subprocess.getoutput(f"sudo systemctl restart {service_name}")

### Step 3: Implement decision logic with LLM

    prompt = f"""
    CPU Load: {get_cpu_load()}%
    Memory Usage: {get_memory_usage()}%

    If either is above 80%, recommend action.
    """

    response = llm.generate(prompt)
    print("Agent Decision:", response)

### Step 4: Automate and schedule

    import schedule
    import time

    def run_monitor():
        # Collect data, generate prompt, log result
        pass

    schedule.every(5).minutes.do(run_monitor)

    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(1)

### Bonus:

- Add Slack or email notifications.
- Allow LLM to inspect logs and recommend configurations.
- Use a file-based memory to track past issues and resolutions.

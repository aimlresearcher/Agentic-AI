# Lecture 10: Introduction to LangChain

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

- Understand what LangChain is and why it's used for building LLM applications.
- Learn core LangChain concepts: chains, agents, tools, and memory.
- Build a basic LangChain-powered agent that uses tools and memory.
- Navigate LangChainâ€™s modular architecture for agentic development.

---

## ðŸ§© Key Concepts

### What is LangChain?

- A Python framework designed to **orchestrate LLMs** in complex workflows.
- Abstracts away the boilerplate for chaining calls, using tools, and managing memory.
- Supports multiple model providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc.).

### LangChain Components

- **LLM**: Interface to call a language model.
- **PromptTemplate**: Formats user input into a model-friendly prompt.
- **Chains**: A sequence of calls (e.g., input â†’ LLM â†’ output).
- **Agents**: Decision-making loop that uses tools and memory.
- **Tools**: External functions (e.g., search, calculator) that the agent can call.
- **Memory**: Stores context and conversation history.

## ðŸ›  Required Tools/Libraries

- Python
- OpenAI API key (or other model provider)
- LangChain

    pip install langchain openai

## ðŸ”¬ Hands-on Exercise: Build a LangChain Agent

**Goal**: Create a basic agent that answers questions using reasoning and tool calls.

### Step 1: Import LangChain components

    from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, load_tools
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI

    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
    tools = load_tools(["serpapi", "llm-math"], llm=llm)

### Step 2: Initialize the agent

    agent = initialize_agent(
        tools=tools,
        llm=llm,
        agent="zero-shot-react-description",
        verbose=True
    )

### Step 3: Run a task

    agent.run("What is the square root of 2025, and who is the current president of the USA?")

### Step 4: Observe outputs

- Look at the intermediate thoughts, actions, and observations.
- How does the agent choose which tool to use?

### Bonus:

- Add memory using `ConversationBufferMemory`.
- Try chaining multiple tools or customizing tool behavior.
- Build your own tool (e.g., weather lookup or file reader) and register it with the agent.

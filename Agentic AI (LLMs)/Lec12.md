# Lecture 12: Toolformer and Self-Learning Agents

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

- Understand the concept and architecture of Toolformer.
- Learn how LLMs can self-label and decide when to invoke tools.
- Analyze the benefit of tool-use annotations within model pretraining.
- Conceptually simulate tool-use decisions in an agent pipeline.

## üß© Key Concepts

### What is Toolformer?

- A self-supervised LLM fine-tuned to **decide when and how to use tools**.
- Developed by Meta AI to enable LLMs to make **tool-use decisions during inference**.
- Key innovation: Automatically annotate training data with tool calls.

### How Toolformer Works

1. Sample tool calls during pretraining using existing API tools.
2. Inject tool outputs back into the context.
3. Train the model to predict when and how to use tools ‚Äî based on context and benefit.

### Benefits of Toolformer-style Agents

- Dynamically decide when tools are helpful.
- Reduce unnecessary tool usage, saving cost and latency.
- More "aware" agents that use external capabilities only when needed.

## üõ† Required Tools/Libraries

- Conceptual (Toolformer is a research prototype, not a maintained package)
- Python for simulation
- OpenAI or Hugging Face LLM APIs (for tool usage decisions)
- (Optional) LangChain agent with dynamic tool routing

## üî¨ Hands-on Exercise: Simulated Tool-Aware Agent

**Goal**: Simulate a Toolformer-like loop by asking the LLM whether a tool is needed before using it.

### Step 1: Define question types and available tools

    tools = {
        "calculator": lambda x: str(eval(x)),
        "search": lambda x: "Simulated search result for: " + x
    }

    examples = [
        "What is 15% of 80?",
        "Who is the current president of the USA?",
        "Translate 'Hello' to French."
    ]

### Step 2: Ask the LLM: ‚ÄúDo you need a tool to answer this?‚Äù

    Prompt:
    "Question: What is 15% of 80?\nShould I use a tool (yes/no)?\nReason:"

    # If LLM says "yes", proceed with tool call

### Step 3: Inject tool output and finalize the answer

    If tool needed:
      - Execute the tool
      - Append result to the prompt
      - Ask LLM to generate the final answer

### Bonus:

- Log tool usage decisions and compare tool vs. no-tool performance.
- Add confidence threshold: only use tools when LLM is uncertain.
- Prototype your own Toolformer-inspired fine-tuning loop using labeled data.

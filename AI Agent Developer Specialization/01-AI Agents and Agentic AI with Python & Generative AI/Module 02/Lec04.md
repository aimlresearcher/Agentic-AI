# The Critical Role of Action Results and Feedback in Agentic AI Systems

This section explains how agentic AI systems use tools or actions step-by-step, relying on **feedback from each action’s outcome** to make decisions and adapt. It explores how this feedback loop works, why it’s essential, and best practices for designing result messages and error handling.

## 1. Key Pieces of Information Extracted

### Agents Cannot Directly Observe Action Outcomes
- Agent issues an action (e.g., “insert food in microwave”).
- It **does not see the result** directly.
- The system or human performing the action must provide **feedback** on the outcome.

### Feedback as Follow-Up Prompts
- After each action, the agent receives a **prompt describing the result**.
- This result prompt replaces the typical human input message in the conversation.
- Agent uses the result to **decide the next action**.

### The Feedback Loop Explained
1. Agent receives goal and instructions.
2. Agent outputs the first action to perform.
3. Human or system executes the action.
4. The result of this action is fed back to the agent as a new prompt.
5. Agent processes result, plans next action.
6. Repeat until task is complete.

### Example: Cooking with a Microwave

**Available tools (actions):**
- microwave_get_current_time
- microwave_reset_time
- microwave_increase_time
- microwave_start
- microwave_stop
- microwave_open_door
- microwave_close_door
- insert_food_in_microwave

**Scenario: Reheating a quesadilla**
- Agent says: “Insert food in microwave.”
- You perform the action, respond: “Food inserted.”
- Agent says: “Increase microwave time.”
- You respond: “Time increased by 5 seconds.”
- Agent adapts and says: “Keep increasing time until total reheating time reached.”
- You respond: “Time set to 60 seconds.”
- Agent says: “Start microwave.”
- You respond: “Error: door open.”
- Agent says: “Close the door.”
- You respond: “Door closed.”
- Agent says: “Start microwave.”
- You respond: “Microwave running.”
- Agent continues until task completion.

### Importance of Clear and Rich Feedback

- Feedback includes **success confirmations**, **error messages**, and **state updates**.
- Rich error messages like “door open” help the agent diagnose and fix issues.
- Ambiguous error codes (e.g., “error 32”) confuse the agent unless translated.
- High-quality feedback prevents the agent from repeating mistakes or getting stuck in loops.

### Moving Toward Real System Integration
- Initially, feedback might be simulated (human faking results).
- Long-term goal: computer systems send actual results back automatically.
- This creates a **closed-loop autonomous system** where agent acts, observes results, and adapts continuously.

## 2. Explanation of Concepts with Simple Examples

### Why Feedback Is Necessary

Imagine giving instructions to someone blindfolded to cook.  
- You say, “Put the quesadilla in microwave.”  
- You don’t see if they did it.  
- They must tell you, “Done.”  
- Based on that, you say, “Set time to 60 seconds.”  
- Without their feedback, you wouldn’t know what to do next.

### Clear Feedback Enables Adaptation

- If the microwave says, “Door is open, can’t start,”  
- The AI can respond: “Close the door.”  
- If it just said, “Error 32,” the AI might be stuck guessing what to do.

| Feedback Type         | Description                             | Effect on Agent                           | Example                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Clear success message | Confirms action completed              | Agent moves to next step confidently      | “Food inserted in microwave.”   |
| Detailed error message| Explains why action failed             | Agent can diagnose and recover            | “Error: door open.”             |
| Ambiguous error code | Coded or unclear message                | Agent confused, may get stuck or fail    | “Error 32.”                    |
| State update          | Informs about current system state     | Agent understands environment better     | “Time increased by 5 seconds.” |

# Final Thoughts

- Providing **accurate, timely, and descriptive feedback** on action results is **critical** for agentic AI success.
- Feedback closes the perception-action loop allowing the agent to adapt and solve complex tasks.
- Error messages must be **clear and meaningful**, avoiding cryptic codes unless the agent is trained on them.
- This framework moves agentic AI from theoretical to practical, enabling integration with real systems.
- Thoughtful design of feedback mechanisms can be the difference between a working AI agent and one stuck in error loops.

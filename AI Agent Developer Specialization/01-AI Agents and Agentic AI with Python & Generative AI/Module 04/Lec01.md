# Innovating with AI Agents: Rethinking Problems, Inputs, and Tools for the Future

This segment encourages a mindset shift in how we approach building AI agents—not just replicating what we can already do but tackling *new, previously impossible problems* by leveraging generative AI innovatively.

## 1. Key Pieces of Information Extracted

### Don’t Just Automate What’s Already Possible
- Avoid rushing to use generative AI for tasks that are already well solved without it.
- Generative AI’s true power lies in solving **problems previously thought impossible or intractable**.
- Aim for innovation, not replication.

### Rethink What Constitutes a Tool
- A tool for an agent can be **more than just software or APIs**.
- It can be a **specialized prompt** that enables capabilities never before possible.
- This expands what agents can do beyond traditional boundaries.

### Expand What Inputs Look Like
- Traditional systems rely on **rigid, fixed inputs** (e.g., typed commands or structured data).
- With generative AI and LLMs, we can process **richer, more diverse inputs**:
  - Photographs
  - Rich conversations
  - Audio
  - Other multimodal data types

### The Future of Computing with Generative AI
- Generative AI will **transform computing paradigms**.
- This creates opportunities to build **extraordinary AI agents** that operate on richer, more human-like inputs and creative problem-solving methods.
- Emphasizes the need to think creatively about designing agents and their tools.

## 2. Explanation of Concepts with Simple Examples

### Innovate Instead of Automate

- **Old Approach:** Automate email sorting with traditional rules.
- **Generative AI Approach:** Build an agent that reads the *tone* and *intent* of emails, prioritizes emotionally urgent messages, and drafts empathetic responses—something hard to do before.

### Tools as Specialized Prompts

- Instead of just APIs or software:
  - A **prompt** that, when given to an LLM, can generate custom legal documents, or craft personalized learning plans.
- This “prompt-as-tool” paradigm unlocks new agent abilities without traditional programming.

### Richer Inputs Example

- Instead of only typing commands, an agent can:
  - Analyze a **photo** of a damaged car to estimate repair costs.
  - Process a **voice message** and extract action items.
  - Understand a **multi-turn conversation** to schedule meetings dynamically.

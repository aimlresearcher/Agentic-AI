# Understanding Agentic AI: A Simplified Guide

---

## 📘 Summary

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to operate with a degree of autonomy, making decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional AI, which typically reacts to specific inputs, Agentic AI can plan, adapt, and respond to dynamic environments. This guide breaks down the concept using a practical cooking example, illustrating how Agentic AI collaborates with humans to accomplish tasks.

## 🧠 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI systems are characterized by their ability to:

- **Perceive**: Gather and interpret information from their environment.
- **Reason**: Analyze data to make informed decisions.
- **Act**: Execute actions to achieve defined objectives.
- **Learn**: Adapt based on feedback and outcomes.

These systems are designed to function with minimal human intervention, adjusting their behavior in response to changing circumstances.

## 🍳 Cooking with Agentic AI: A Step-by-Step Example

### 1. **Initiating the Task**

A user prompts the AI:

> "You're going to help me cook whatever I need. Since you can't directly lift pots or pans or get to the fridge, you will tell me the steps, and I will perform them. We will go one step at a time. Ask me what I want to cook."

This sets up a collaborative scenario where the AI provides instructions, and the human executes them.

### 2. **Defining the Goal**

The user specifies:

> "I'd like to cook a dish that combines the flavors of Ethiopia and Uzbekistan, is keto-friendly, and under 1000 calories."

The AI responds by proposing a suitable recipe that meets these criteria.

### 3. **Executing Steps with Feedback**

The AI provides detailed instructions:

- **Marinate the Meat**: Mix specified spices and coat the meat thoroughly.
- **Cook the Meat**: Heat oil in a skillet, add the marinated meat, and cook for 5–7 minutes.

After each step, the user informs the AI of completion, allowing it to proceed to the next instruction.

### 4. **Adapting to Changes**

If the user encounters an issue, such as the meat starting to burn, they inform the AI:

> "The meat is starting to burn."

The AI adapts its instructions:

> "Reduce the heat to medium or medium-low immediately. You can also add a splash of water or broth to the pan to deglaze it and prevent further burning."

### 5. **Handling Unexpected Inputs**

When the AI requests vegetables, and the user responds:

> "No vegetables, but I have durian fruit."

The AI adjusts its plan:

> "Durian is quite different from vegetables, but let's adapt. Here's how to prepare the durian fruit..."

This demonstrates the AI's flexibility in handling unforeseen scenarios.

# Understanding Agentic AI and the Flipped Interaction Pattern

This lecture explains how agentic AI systems, like those powered by large language models (LLMs), can take initiative in problem-solving. Instead of us always telling the system what to do, these systems can ask questions, adapt based on our answers, and take actions step-by-step to achieve a goal. A key method is the "flipped interaction" where the AI drives the interaction by gathering information or taking actions.

## What Is the Flipped Interaction Pattern?

- Instead of you asking the system a question, the system asks **you** questions.
- It can also ask **other computer systems** for information or tell them to perform tasks.
- You give it a goal, and it figures out what steps to take to reach that goal.

### Example Setup

Imagine you're in Nashville, Tennessee, and you want help picking a restaurant tonight. You give the AI this goal:

> "Ask me questions one at a time to help choose a restaurant in Nashville for dinner tonight. Start with the first question."

The AI starts asking:

1. **What kind of food are you in the mood for?**
   - You say: *Tex-Mex*
2. **Any dietary needs or preferences?**
   - You say: *No*
3. **Do you want something casual or upscale?**
   - You say: *Kid-friendly*
4. **Indoor or outdoor seating?**
   - You say: *Doesn’t matter—it’s raining*
5. **Do you want to stay in a specific area?**
   - You say: *Near Vanderbilt*
6. **How far are you willing to travel?**
   - You say: *Short drive—5–10 minutes*
7. **Do you need a reservation, or is walk-in fine?**
   - You say: *Walk-in is fine, but not a long wait*

Based on your answers, the AI might recommend **Rosepepper Cantina**. You check Google Maps and respond:

> "It’s 13 minutes away—too far."

The AI updates its answer:

> "Try SATCo—it’s right across from Vanderbilt."

## Why This Is Powerful

- The AI **adapts** its behavior based on your answers.
- It doesn’t just follow a script. It makes decisions step-by-step.
- It handles all sorts of input formats, even free-text replies.

This mirrors how it would interact with other systems, like databases:

- If it talks to a **person**, it uses human language.
- If it talks to a **database**, it uses the database’s specific language (e.g., SQL).

### Real-Life Analogy

Think of it like the protocol droids in *Star Wars* that speak many languages and help people and machines communicate. The AI acts as a smart translator and task manager.

## What Makes Agentic AI Different

- **Traditional AI**: You give a single prompt or question, and it responds.
- **Agentic AI**: You give a goal, and it:
  - Breaks it into smaller tasks
  - Decides what to do first
  - Takes action
  - Sees what happened
  - Adapts the next step accordingly

It keeps repeating this loop until the goal is complete.

## Glossary

- **Agentic AI**: AI that can take initiative, break tasks into steps, and adapt based on results.
- **Prompt engineering**: Crafting inputs (prompts) to get useful responses from AI.
- **Flipped interaction**: A method where the AI asks questions or takes action, instead of waiting for instructions.
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: AI systems trained on lots of text to understand and generate human-like language.
- **Tex-Mex**: A style of food combining Texan and Mexican cuisine.
- **Protocol droid**: A fictional robot in *Star Wars* that translates and communicates between languages and systems.
- **Database**: A structured system for storing and retrieving data.
